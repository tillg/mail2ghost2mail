# mail2ghost2mail

Interfacing Ghost with Emails: Sending out emails when new posts are published and creating new posts by sending emails.

## How to run it

Prerequisites:

* Node js installed

Get the code, install the dependencies and start it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tillg/mail2ghost2mail.git
cd mail2ghost2mail
npm i
npm start
```

Of course it will need some configuration ðŸ˜€ ...see below...

## Configuring

`mail2ghost2mail` has a couple of confguration areas and options:

### Access secrets

In order to read/write emails and ghost posts it needs acess to those 2 systems. This information is held in the `.env` file. You can create and edit it like so:

```shell
cd src
cp sample.env .env
```

Then edit the file `.env` and enter your configuration for accessing the email account as well as the Ghost API.

### Email addresses --> ghost author

When creating a new blog post based on an incoming email we need to set the author. This is based on a mapping between email senders and ghost authors. This way a blog author can send from multiple email addresses (i.e. his office and private email account).

This mapping is described in the `config/default.json` file. The file structure is like so:

```json
{
	"validAuthors": {
		"till": {
			"emailAddresses": ["till.gartner@gmail.com", "till.gartner@googlemail.com", "till.gartner@mgm-tp.com", "till@mgm-tp.com"],
			"ghostUser": "till.gartner @gmail.com "
		},
		"henry": {
			"emailAddresses": ["hwhinrichs@gmail.com"],
			"ghostUser": "hwhinrichs@gmail.com"
		}
	}
}
```

## To do

Things that need to be done:

* Mapping email addresses of senders to author IDs in Ghost
* Sending out emails when new blog posts are created
